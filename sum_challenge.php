/*
* The function below creates a hashmap of integer pairs and values. The function contains a foorlop that iterates through each item
* in the array specified by the user, and checks to see if the needed number is present in the array. Tis needed number is gotten 
* by subtracting the target number from each of the given elements in the array. This method is based on the premise that the inverse
* of addition is subtraction, thus making it possible for us to identify the correct pairs. If the algorithm finds it, it returns the
* two numbers that gave us the needed number. If it does not, it returns nothing.
